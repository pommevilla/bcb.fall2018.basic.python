Alternatively, if you want to only run a few select lines, highlight them and press Control + Enter (on Windows) or Command + Enter (on Mac). The most basic use for the editor is to store lines of code you've written so that you can rerun them whenever you want.  Eventually, we will write programs and modules.\n",
    "* **Pane 2** contains the **variable explorer** and **file explorer**.  The **variable explorer** lets you see the values of variables at a glance.  The **file explorer** is a basic file navigation system.  Click the tabs at the bottom of this pane to switch between the two.\n",
    "* **Pane 3** contains the **iPython console** and the **history log**.  The **iPython console** (referred to as the **console** from here on) is an interactive coding environment that you can run commands in.  The **history log** is a record of the last commands you entered.  Click the tabs at the bottom of this pane to switch between the two.  \n",
